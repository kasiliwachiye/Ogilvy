            Future Earth carries the dream of a world where everyone has access
            to safe housing, sustainable livelihoods, education and healthcare,
            as well as opportunities to create a legacy for future generations.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Using the PATHWAY model we have created a self-sustaining ecosystem
            that will fulfill the long-term needs of people in need, not just at
            a basic level but with the potential to create wealth. iRise Homes
            are low-cost, easy-to-construct houses that we designed with women
            and youth in mind, from construction to functionality. They are
            built with sustainable timber, with each house embedded with
            amenities, including renewable solar energy and digital
            connectivity.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            More than just a place to call home, we have ensured that our houses
            are also the springboard for opportunity and a better life. Each
            house comes with a fruit garden that provides an income for the
            household and the financial means to pay the mortgage.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            To allow access to more resources, we will construct in every
            community a central borehole facility to provide access to clean
            water. Through our building technology, we will also put up schools
            and health clinics for the communityâ€™s access to quality education
            and health service.
