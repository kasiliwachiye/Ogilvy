          Instead of implementing a single component of a solution across
          multiple communities, as has been done in the past, we focus on
          delivering an integrated economic system to a community to help lift
          it to a sustainable minimum standard of living from which it can grow
          and progress independently. We have therefore identified and made
          collaborative efforts with organizations that share our vision and
          help steer it forward.

          In future we hope to collaborate with delivery partners such as
          Adelphi, J&J, and Westfalia Fruit; with the financial backing of
          recognized financial institutions such as TDB, Standard Bank,
          Rockefeller Foundation, World Bank IFC, AgDevCo, and World Bank IBRD.

          Our most critical partners are the communities we hope to transform,
          and it is only by working in partnership with local leaders and our
          future residents that we will pilot, test and refine a model that
          truly works for them.
