          Future Earthâ€™s blueprint is based on a model that was designed by one
          of our founders, Maya Minkova, 25 years ago while still a student, for
          a safe and sustainable homes project in South African townships. We
          have adapted the PATHWAY (power, agriculture, technology, housing,
          women and youth) model as the framework that outlines our projects.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 text-base font-light leading-relaxed text-gray-900">
          We believe that women and the youth, who make up more than half of the
          society, are critical in unlocking self-development. The project will
          target women as homeowners, giving them assets and credit and
          therefore power to self-develop. We also emphasize support for SMEs
          owned by women and young people to provide services within the
          community.
